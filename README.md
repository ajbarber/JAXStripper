# JAXStripper
Remove JAXB generated bindings and javax.* classes from the `xjc` tool output

## What JAXStripper is used for

Generating Android java domain model classes from an xsd.

If you have ever had a need to generate java model classes from an xsd you would be familiar with the `jaxb` suite, as in [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.xml.bind/jaxb-xjc)

JAXStripper removes all the javax dependencies on the `xjc` output.

Use 

```
$> stripjax.pl myJavaModels(s).java
```

where `myJavaModels(s).java` are the java classes generated by the xjc tool. `stripjax.pl` will remove all the javax annotations, and replace occurrences `XMLGregorianCalendar` with `java.util.Date`.
